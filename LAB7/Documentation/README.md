Lab7:

The Ionic application developed using ngCordova plugins - inappbrowser, ngCordovaOauth enables the user to login using google and facebook.
Social login is using the inappbrowser and not native based hence the user has to give the credentails everytime he uses the app  this makes the application secure. After the user logs in the user basic profile info will be displayed on the home page.
