<b>About the project:</b>

“IM Word” is a hybrid application with the main idea to offer image based learning of vocabulary which is more easy and efficient. Our objective is to build a game combined with hint images and words which helps users to expand their knowledge in vocabulary. In turn, this also helps to users learn a new language which is a very good use of our application. In addition to these the application also includes the logo identification game with a recommendation system to suggest logos of other similar organizations. Moreover, we would like to also include celebrity identification using their images. All these services are offered only when the user registers in the application. We are also including the social sign in plugins so that any user can login without the hassle of signup/registration forms. The word building game with images consists of three levels. Further, We have also included the kid and adult mode in the app which distinguishes the complete view/game experience and the difficulty in levels of the game.
